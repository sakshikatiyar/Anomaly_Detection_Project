# üõ°Ô∏è Access Log Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest

This project uses **unsupervised machine learning** to detect anomalies in system access logs ‚Äî helping identify suspicious activities such as failed login attempts, unusual IP behavior, or access outside working hours. The model used is **Isolation Forest**, which is well-suited for detecting outliers in high-dimensional datasets without requiring labeled training data.

## üìÅ Dataset Description

The dataset contains simulated system access logs with the following fields:

| Column         | Description                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `timestamp`    | Date and time of the access attempt            |
| `ip_address`   | IP address of the user/system making the request |
| `action`       | Type of action (login, upload, download, etc.) |
| `resource`     | What was accessed (portal, file, admin page)   |
| `status_code`  | HTTP-like response code (e.g., 200, 403)       |
| `anomaly_label`| Ground truth label (0 = normal, 1 = anomaly)   |

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Parsed timestamps into features: `hour` and `day_of_week`
   - Encoded categorical fields: `action`, `resource`, and `ip_address`

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Selected 6 features for modeling:
     - `hour`, `day_of_week`, `action_encoded`, `resource_encoded`, `ip_encoded`, `status_code`

3. **Modeling**
   - Used **Isolation Forest** (`sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest`)
   - Parameters:
     - `n_estimators=100`
     - `contamination=0.2` (estimated 20% of logs as anomalies)

4. **Output**
   - Generated `predicted_anomaly` column (1 = anomaly, 0 = normal)
   - Results exported to Excel: `access_log_anomaly_detected.xlsx`
